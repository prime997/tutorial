The list of values stored in _data can be accessed with the site.data_ command. 
Using the Liquid logic brackets, we iterate through the list of data, and item.link references the variables set in the list.

The second piece of logic then compares the current page, obtained with page.url, and compares it to the listed item. If the listed item matches, the format is changed to red.

    <h1>Kiwifruit</h1>
<p>22 Aug 2018 - ted</p>

<p>Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</p>

<p>The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen’s egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.</p>
