The list of values stored in _data can be accessed with the site.data_ command. 
Using the Liquid logic brackets, we iterate through the list of data, and item.link references the variables set in the list.

The second piece of logic then compares the current page, obtained with page.url, and compares it to the listed item. If the listed item matches, the format is changed to red.

<!-- The HTML has been replaced with a layout that wraps around the content of the page. The layout is located in the _layouts folder -->

<!-- Any page with Front Matter layout variable set to 'default' will wrap the content of the page with this HTML  -->

<!-- The % { brackets inform Liquid to execute logic, in this case to load or include the file navigation from the _includes folder  -->
